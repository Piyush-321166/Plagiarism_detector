account, and  orders.  The project uses  Java for the backend, featuring  a clean,  
intuitive  layout for the  users  to navigate  categories  such as “Recent  Books”.“New  
Books”  and “Old  Books”

for educational and recreational resources is increasingly popular. The platform 
caters to a diverse audience,  including students, professionals,  and casual readers 
by offering  
A wide  range  of genres like  technical  books,  children’s  literature,  and popular  fiction.  
 
 
The front end, with its clean layout and responsive design, ensures accessibility 
across devices, while the back end handles complex operations like user 
authentication, payment processing, and inventory management. This dual -layered 
approach ensures that the system is both user -centric and administratively 
efficient, making it a valuable tool for book enthusiasts and bookstore operators 
alike.
